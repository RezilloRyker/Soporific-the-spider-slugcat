Install:
Before installing this mod it is Required to also have slugbase:
https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugBase
1. Unzip the folders, go inside SpiderSlugCat and then copy the folder called "mod"
2. paste that folder into your mods folder located around here: Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods
3. rename the mod folder to "SpiderSlugCat" and it should work just fine after you also install slugbase;

# Soporific-the-spider-slugcat
Soporific the Slugcat that can shoot darts that put other living things to sleep.
You only eat meat as plants will not provide food for you. Your bite is powerful but risk waking them up.

Features:
-shoots up to 3 darts at a time (throw) button while not holding anything then recharges for 5 seconds each dart
-Your bite power is 5 damage
-hold a spear on back
-crawl very fast. Even on pipes and tunnels.
-The world takes place in Artificer or if without downpour then it be hunter's world.
-Remix menu for extra options to adjust rate, bite damage and other settings

(Dress my slug) mod
is highly recommended for cosmetics and pictures are shown to go in Get fancy menu and select the Spider slugcat sprites. Also showing the settings I figured that fitting for the tail.
